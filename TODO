This is in no way supposed to be a complete list of all open issues,
it's nothing more than a brain dump.

- Make shiny looking website -- maybe
- Document how to write extensions
- Encourage people to translate the administration interface
- Finish frontend editing -- not much more than a proof of concept now
- Document template tags


Infanta - a FeinCMS extension for easy integrate reusable django apps
---------------------------------------------------------------------

- command for filling up the tree with the pages from the reusable app and automaticaly attaching ViewContents as placeholders
- attach a view content which is not defined in the page tree at the end of the region
- decide what to do if a region defined in the templatetag is not found
  for example a extrajs block, which should be rendered in the <head> tag

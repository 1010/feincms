This is in no way supposed to be a complete list of all open issues,
it's nothing more than a brain dump.

- Write even more and even better documentation
- Make shiny looking website -- maybe
- Think about the hardcoded 'template' stuff in the change_view
- Do not include more javascript than necessary -- we do not net all of jQuery.ui
- It's not too bad to set the language on every page, but! the translation stuff
  does not work correctly. Think about the content model some more (or think on
  building a GUI which is logical)

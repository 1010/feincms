This is in no way supposed to be a complete list of all open issues,
it's nothing more than a brain dump.

- Write more and better documentation
- Make shiny looking website -- maybe
- Think about the hardcoded 'template' stuff in the change_view
- The template tags feel fragile and ugly
- Do not include more javascript than necessary -- we do not net all of jQuery.ui
- Cleanup template code
- It's not too bad to set the language on every page, but! the translation stuff
  does not work correctly. Think about the content model some more (or think on
  building a GUI which is logical)
- Implement higher-level rendering methods so that the results can be more easily
  cached (maybe in ContentProxy?)

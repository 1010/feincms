This is in no way supposed to be a complete list of all open issues,
it's nothing more than a brain dump.

- Write even more and even better documentation
- Make shiny looking website -- maybe
- Do not include more javascript than necessary -- we do not net all of jQuery.ui
- Document how to write extensions
- Encourage people to translate the administration interface
- Finish frontend editing -- not much more than a proof of concept now

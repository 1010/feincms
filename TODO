This is in no way supposed to be a complete list of all open issues,
it's nothing more than a brain dump.

- Move NavigationExtension into an extension module -- it's not used that much.
  Part of it is implementing an extension infrastructure for the base models.
  Other ideas: SEOExtension, SubtitleExtension, ...
- Write more and better documentation
- Make shiny looking website -- maybe
- Use list_display tuple for items in tree view
- Think about the hardcoded 'template' stuff in the change_view
- Add more default content types -- batteries are not yet included...
- The template tags feel fragile and ugly
- Do not include more javascript than necessary -- we do not net all of jQuery.ui
- Cleanup template code
- It's not too bad to set the language on every page, but! the translation stuff
  does not work correctly. Think about the content model some more (or think on
  building a GUI which is logical)
- Implement higher-level rendering methods so that the results can be more easily
  cached (maybe in ContentProxy?)

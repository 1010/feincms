This is in no way supposed to be a complete list of all open issues,
it's nothing more than a brain dump.

- Make shiny looking website -- maybe
- Document how to write extensions
- Encourage people to translate the administration interface
- Finish frontend editing -- not much more than a proof of concept now
- Document template tags
- ajax_editable_boolean functionality is very non-obvious to the admin
  interface user
- the tree editor drag/drop icons seem to be unclear

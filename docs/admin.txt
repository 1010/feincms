===========================
The FeinCMS admin interface
===========================

FeinCMS provides two mixins for the ModelAdmin classes, `ItemEditorMixin` and
`TreeEditorMixin`. Their purpose and their customization hooks are briefly
discussed here.


The tree editor
===============

The tree editor replaces the standard change list interface with a collapsible,
drag-drop-enabled item tree. The model must be registered with `django-mptt`
for this to work.

Usage is as follows:

::
    from django.contrib import admin
    from feincms.admin import editor
    from yourapp.models import YourModel

    class YourModelAdmin(editor.TreeEditorMixin, admin.ModelAdmin):
        pass

    admin.site.register(YourModel, YourModelAdmin)


The columns shown in the tree editor can be specified using list_display. Please
note that the first column is hardcoded as the value of __unicode__ currently.
In the future, the tree editor might even take the setting `list_editable`
into account.

Please note that you need to put the `TreeEditorMixin` before the standard
`ModelAdmin` class, because otherwise the standard methods will not be
overridden.


The item editor
===============

The tree editor replaces the edit view (NOT the add form, therefore you may
still use `fieldsets`, etc. to customize the form which is used to add new
items.

Customization the item editor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* show_on_top

  A tuple which describes, which fields should be shown above the tabbed item
  editor interface.


Customizing the individual content type forms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Customizing the individual content type editors is easily possible through two
settings on the content type model itself:

* feincms_item_editor_form:

  You can specify the base class which should be used for the content type
  model. The default value is `django.forms.ModelForm`.

* feincms_item_editor_includes:

  If you need additional javascript or CSS files or need to perform additional
  initialization on your content type forms, you can specify template fragments
  which are included in predefined places into the item editor.

  If you need to execute additional javascript, f.e. add a TinyMCE instance,
  it is recommended to add the initialization functions to the
  `contentblock_init_handlers` array, because the initialization needs to be
  performed not only on page load, but also after drag-dropping a content block
  and after adding new content blocks. Take a look at the `mediafile` and
  `richtext` item editor include files to understand how this should be done.



Putting it all together
=======================

Best advice here is taking a look at the files inside `feincms/module/page/`.

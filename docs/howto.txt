===================================
HOWTO: Use the built-in page module
===================================

FeinCMS is primarily a system to work with lists of content blocks which
you can assign to arbitrary other objects. You do not necessarily have to
use it with a hierarchical page structure, but that's the most common use
case of course. Being able to put content together in small manageable
pieces is interesting for other uses too, f.e. for weblog entries where you
have rich text content interspersed with images, videos or maybe even galleries.

To activate the page module, you need to follow the instructions in
installation.txt and afterwards add ``feincms.module.page'' to your
``INSTALLED_APPS''.

The default is currently to create ``ImageContent``and ``RichTextContent''
models for pages. This might change in the future, especially since there is
conceptually no possibility to un-create models. It would be possible in
principle to unregister them, but the models and the associated database tables
would still get created.

FeinCMS Installation Instructions

Installation
============

This document describes the steps needed to get FeinCMS up and running.

FeinCMS is based on Django, so you need a working Django_ installation
first. I'm developing FeinCMS using a Subversion_ checkout of Django_,
but any version which is at least 1.0 should work currently. If it does
not, this is considered a bug and I'd be happy to hear about it.

Since there are no official releases of FeinCMS yet, you need to download
a development snapshot. The following command will download the latest
version of FeinCMS using the Git_ version control system:

::

    $ git clone git://github.com/matthiask/feincms.git

In addition, you will need a django-mptt_ installation.


.. _Django: http://www.djangoproject.com/
.. _Git: http://git-scm.com/
.. _Subversion: http://subversion.tigris.org/
.. _django-mptt: http://code.google.com/p/django-mptt/



Configuration
=============

There isn't much left to do apart from adding FeinCMS to INSTALLED_APPS.
The customized administration interface needs some media and javascript
libraries, which you have to make available to the browser. You should
publish the files in the folder `feincms/media/` somewhere on your site
and set the FEINCMS_ADMIN_MEDIA to the location. You can do this either
by copying the media files into your media folder or by installing a
symlink to the correct place.

That's it! You have successfully installed FeinCMS now.

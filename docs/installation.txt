FeinCMS Installation Instructions
=================================

Installation
============

This document describes the steps needed to get FeinCMS up and running.

FeinCMS is based on Django, so you need a working Django_ installation
first. I'm developing FeinCMS using a Subversion_ checkout of Django_,
but any version which is at least 1.0 should work currently. If it does
not, this is considered a bug and I'd be happy to hear about it.

Since there are no official releases of FeinCMS yet, you need to download
a development snapshot. The following command will download the latest
version of FeinCMS using the Git_ version control system:

::

    $ git clone git://github.com/matthiask/feincms.git

In addition, you will need a django-mptt_ installation (The released
version 0.2.1 is incompatible with Django SVN trunk, you need to get a
django-mptt version from SVN too.)

.. _Subversion: http://subversion.tigris.org/
.. _django-mptt: http://code.google.com/p/django-mptt/



Configuration
=============

There isn't much left to do apart from adding 'feincms' to INSTALLED_APPS.
The customized administration interface needs some media and javascript
libraries, which you have to make available to the browser. You should
publish the files in the folder `feincms/media/` somewhere on your site
and set the FEINCMS_ADMIN_MEDIA to the location. You can do this either
by copying the media files into your media folder or by installing a
symlink to the correct place.

Please note that the 'feincms' module will not create or need any database
tables, but you need to put it into INSTALLED_APPS because otherwise the
templates in feincms/templates/ will not be found by the template loader.



The page module
===============

The tools contained in FeinCMS can be used for many CMS-related
activities. The most common use of a CMS is to manage a hierarchy of
pages and this is the most advanced module of FeinCMS too. Please
proceed to howto-page.txt to find out how you can get the page module
up and running.

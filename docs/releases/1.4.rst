====================================
FeinCMS 1.4 release notes (upcoming)
====================================

* Support for the ``show_on_top`` option for the ``ItemEditor`` has been
  completely removed. This functionatliy has been deprecated since 1.2.

* FeinCMS 1.2 removed the CKEditor-specific rich text content in favor of a
  generalized rich text content supporting different rich text editors.
  Unfortunately the documentation and the available settings only reflected
  this partially. This has been rectified. Support for ``TINYMCE_JS_URL``,
  ``FEINCMS_TINYMCE_INIT_TEMPLATE`` and ``FEINCMS_TINYMCE_INIT_CONTEXT`` has
  been completely removed. The two settings ``FEINCMS_RICHTEXT_INIT_CONTEXT``
  and ``FEINCMS_RICHTEXT_INIT_TEMPLATE`` should be used instead. See the
  :ref:`contenttypes` documentation for more details.

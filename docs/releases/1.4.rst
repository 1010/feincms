====================================
FeinCMS 1.4 release notes (upcoming)
====================================

* Support for the ``show_on_top`` option for the ``ItemEditor`` has been
  completely removed. This functionatliy has been deprecated since 1.2.

* FeinCMS 1.2 removed the CKEditor-specific rich text content in favor of a
  generalized rich text content supporting different rich text editors.
  Unfortunately the documentation and the available settings only reflected
  this partially. This has been rectified. Support for ``TINYMCE_JS_URL``,
  ``FEINCMS_TINYMCE_INIT_TEMPLATE`` and ``FEINCMS_TINYMCE_INIT_CONTEXT`` has
  been completely removed. The two settings ``FEINCMS_RICHTEXT_INIT_CONTEXT``
  and ``FEINCMS_RICHTEXT_INIT_TEMPLATE`` should be used instead. See the
  :ref:`contenttypes` documentation for more details.

* The two settings ``FEINCMS_MEDIALIBRARY_ROOT`` and
  ``FEINCMS_MEDIALIBRARY_URL`` have been removed. Their values always
  defaulted to ``MEDIA_ROOT`` and ``MEDIA_URL``. The way they were used
  made it hard to support other storage backends in the media library.
  If you still need to customize the storage class used in the media
  library have a look at ``MediaFile.reconfigure``.

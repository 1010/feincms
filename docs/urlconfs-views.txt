Integrating FeinCMS on your site
================================

With FeinCMS come a set of standard views which you might want to check
out before starting to write your own. Included is a standard view for
pages, and a set of generic view drop-in replacements which know about
the CMS.


Default page handler
====================

The default CMS handler view is feincms.views.base.handler. You can
add the following as last line in your `urls.py` to make a catch-all
for any pages which were not matched before:

::

    urlpatterns += patterns('',
        url(r'^$|^(.*)/$', 'feincms.views.base.handler'),
    )

Note that this default handler can also take a keyword parameter "page"
to specify which url to render. You can use that functionality to
implement a default page by adding a clause to your urls.py:

::

        url(r'^$', 'feincms.views.base.handler', { 'path': '/rootpage' })


Generic views replacements
==========================

FeinCMS does not force you to leave the awesome generic views of Django
behind. To the contrary, the exactly same code can be used by simply
replacing `django.views.generic` with `feincms.views.generic` (if you
want to use CMS content of course, if you do not want that then you can
use Django's generic views like you already know it).

The only thing the FeinCMS views additionally do is finding the best
matching page for the current request and add it as `feincms_page` to
the `extra_context` argument for the generic view.
